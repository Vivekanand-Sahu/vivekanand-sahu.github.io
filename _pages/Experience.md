## Machine Learning Engineer
## *Alkermes, Massachusetts  |  Jun 2024 â€“ Sep 2024*

Advanced drug discovery by leveraging an LLM foundation model to identify target genes for brain disorders. Achieved 0.9 F1 score in disease classification by fine-tuning on 50K scRNA samples using Distributed Multi-GPU training. Simulated gene regulation hypotheses by deploying the model with Azure ML and Databricks. Accelerated research timelines by 5 years and reduced costs by 50% by identifying six key genes that shift diseased cells to a healthy state.
